# Testing

Player Data Rescue handles player saves. A regression can destroy someone's data, so tests are part of every change.

## Layers

| Layer | Covers | Runs |
|---|---|---|
| Unit tests (JUnit 6) | Pure logic in the shared core | Every pull request |
| Fixture tests | Behaviour against real files produced by the game | Every pull request |
| Production-JAR smoke test | The packaged JAR on a real dedicated server for each band and loader | Every band on every pull request and every push to `dev` or `main` |
| Dev-only test mod | Deliberately triggers the failures the mod handles, so the smoke test can reproduce them | Loaded only by the smoke harness, never published |

The smoke test installs the loader's real dedicated server, drops the packaged JAR (and the dev-only test mod when a scenario needs it), boots the server, runs the scenario and checks the result in the files and logs. Dev runs (`runServer`, `runGameTestServer`) are not used as a release gate: they gave non-reproducible results across loader toolchains on Pala's Item Clear.

## Rules

- Every bug fix comes with a test that fails without the fix.
- Fixtures are real files captured from the game, kept small, each with a short note saying how it was made (Minecraft version, loader, steps).
- Tests use temporary directories and never touch a real user directory.
- Destructive operations are tested in dry-run and in real mode, and the result is compared with the expected state.
- Smoke runs longer than five minutes run in the background.

## Scenarios

The acceptance scenarios are listed in [SPEC.md](SPEC.md). Each one maps to at least one automated test.
